### Analysis
The credentials are correct but the account "Zarex" is showing as inactive. This can happen due to:

1. **Account Suspension**: Balance issues or policy violations
2. **Service Interruption**: Temporary OsonSMS system maintenance
3. **Account Settings**: API access needs manual activation
4. **Payment Status**: Account requires payment or balance top-up

### Recommended Actions

1. Log into OsonSMS web interface
2. Verify account status and balance
3. Check for any notifications or warnings
