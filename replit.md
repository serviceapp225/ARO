# AUTOBID.TJ - Auto Auction Platform

## Overview
AUTOBID.TJ is a comprehensive auto auction platform built for the Tajikistan market. The application allows users to browse, bid on, and sell vehicles through an online auction system. It features a modern React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend, using PostgreSQL for data persistence and Drizzle ORM for database operations.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: Context API for global state (Auth, Auctions, Favorites, Alerts)
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Performance**: Image optimization with Sharp.js, caching strategies implemented

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js for REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **File Handling**: Multer for file uploads with image processing
- **Performance**: Multi-level caching (in-memory, HTTP headers)

## Key Components

### User System
- **Authentication**: Username/email based login system
- **User Activation**: Admin-controlled user activation system
- **Roles**: Admin, Seller, Buyer role management
- **Profile Management**: User profiles with photo upload support

### Auction System
- **Listing Management**: Create, edit, and manage vehicle listings
- **Bidding Engine**: Real-time bidding with automatic price updates
- **Timer System**: Fixed auction end times to prevent manipulation
- **Status Management**: Pending, Active, Ended, Rejected statuses
- **Image Handling**: Multiple photos per listing with compression

### Admin Panel Integration
- **Retool Integration**: Complete admin dashboard for user and listing management
- **API Endpoints**: Dedicated admin endpoints with authentication
- **Statistics**: System-wide statistics and reporting
- **Moderation**: Content moderation and approval workflows

### Mobile Optimization
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with touch-friendly interfaces
- **Progressive Web App**: PWA capabilities for mobile app-like experience
- **Performance**: Optimized for mobile networks with image compression

## Data Flow

### User Authentication Flow
1. User logs in with username/email and password
2. Server validates credentials and creates session
3. User activation status checked for bidding permissions
4. Context providers manage authentication state globally

### Auction Bidding Flow
1. User browses active auctions
2. Real-time price updates from server
3. Bid placement with validation and authorization
4. Automatic current bid updates across all clients
5. Notification system for outbid alerts

### Image Processing Flow
1. Image upload with size validation
2. Sharp.js processing for optimization (quality 75-85%)
3. Multiple format support (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
4. Caching with HTTP headers for performance
5. URL-based serving with separate endpoints

## External Dependencies

- **Environment**: Production-optimized with automatic scaling
- **Database**: PostgreSQL provisioned through Replit
- **Static Assets**: Served through Express with caching headers
- **Health Checks**: Multiple endpoints for deployment monitoring

### Performance Optimizations
- **Image Compression**: 85% reduction in image sizes (1.2MB â†’ 150-180KB)
- **API Optimization**: Response size reduced from 9MB to 6.3KB
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching (memory, HTTP, browser)
- **Database Optimization**: Selective queries and indexing
- **Bundle Splitting**: Optimized JavaScript bundles for faster loading

### Development Workflow
- **Hot Reload**: Vite HMR for instant development feedback
