# AUTOAUCTION - Flutter Car Auction Marketplace

A comprehensive Flutter mobile application for car auctions with clean architecture and organized screen structure.

## üì± App Structure

### Screens Organization
All screens are organized in the `lib/screens/` directory:

- `home_screen.dart` - Main dashboard with featured auctions and categories
- `auction_feed.dart` - Browse all active auctions with filtering
- `auction_detail_screen.dart` - Detailed auction view with bidding functionality
- `search_screen.dart` - Advanced search with filters and sorting
- `sell_car_screen.dart` - Complete car listing form for sellers
- `my_bids_screen.dart` - User's bid history with tabs (Active/Won/Lost)
- `profile_screen.dart` - User profile management and settings
- `login_screen.dart` - Authentication with login/register tabs

### Navigation Structure
The app uses a bottom navigation bar with 6 main sections:
- **Home** - Featured content and quick access
- **Auctions** - Live auction feed
- **Search** - Find specific vehicles
- **Sell** - List your car for auction
- **My Bids** - Track your bidding activity
- **Profile** - Account management
